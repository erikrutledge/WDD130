                    <h2>#1 - What are the different types of climbing?</h2>
                    <p>There are many different ways of rock climbing, but the 3 ones we will refer to here are: top roping, lead climbing, and bouldering. Top roping is the most similar to what you would see in the gym and consists of the rope going from the belayer through the top loops of the route to the climber. Lead climbing is similar, but instead of starting with the rope at the top, you need to climb to bolts in the rock and clip in as you go. Bouldering is much different because you'll never get higher that 10 feet off the ground so ropes are not needed, instead you use pads on the ground and have your partners spot you to keep your head from hitting the ground if you fall.</p>

                    <h2>#2 - Is climbing outdoors safe?</h2>
                    <p>There is always a certain level of risk when rock climbinb, but going outdoors on rock isn't nessecarily any more dangerous than being in the gym. You are at risk of obtaining the same injuries, but since these outdoor location are often further away from medical treatment it's wise to always err on the side of caution and not take unnessecary risks.</p>

                    <h2>#3 - What is belaying?</h2>
                    <p>Belaying is the act of pulling slack out of the rope so if the climber loses their grip they won't fall and risk injury. Belayers and climbers go hand in hand and work as a team, communication between them is crucial for both of their safety. If you've never been climbing or learned how to belay please go to your local rock climbing gym to become certified in this critical role.</p>

                <h2>Teton Dam</h2>

                    <img class="explore-img" src="images/teton_dam.jpeg" alt="man climbing on boulder next to river">
                    <p>The teton dam is a playground for boulderers. When the teton dam broke 1976 the rushing water behind it dislodges many large boulders and threw them around this whole valley. Walking along the river makes for some beautiful views and it's easy to stumble upon large rocks great for bouldering. There are more than 80 reported climbs in this area all of which are bouldering so switch your rope out for a pad and bring some friends to spot you. The routes rank anywhere from V2 - V11 so there's something for everyone here.</p>

                <h2>Heise Rock</h2>
                <section id="explore-grid">
                    <img class="explore-img" src="images/heise_rock.jpeg" alt="large boulder in a grassy field">
                    <p>Heise Rock is a large boulder placed into a field like it was dropped from the sky. There are multiple routes around this rock, but the main pro to this spot is that the ground around the bottom is a flat lawn making belaying a breeze. The routes here range from 5.6 - 5.12 with the majority being 5.11 and 5.12. Recent reports say that the property was recently bought and the owner does not allow use of the rock at this time, but we will contine to update as more information becomes available.</p>

                <h2>Pointless Crag</h2>
                <section id="explore-grid">
                    <img class="explore-img" src="images/pointless.jpeg" alt="wide image of a wall of rock">
                    <p>The pointless crag is one of the most recognizable in this area. It's a long, uniform rock wall with about 18 routes ranging from 5.7 - 5.12b. The great part about this place is that if you're not comfortable lead climbing, you don't have to! It's an easy hike around the right side of the wall to get to the top and simply tying the rope into the top anchors makes it an easy top roping experience just like if you were in the gym. The ground around the base of the hill is a little steep so finding a comfortable place to belay from is the biggest challenge here.</p>

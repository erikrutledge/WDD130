      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever been lost in the woods? I have and it's not fun.

        The sport of rock climbing is different than most other sports because it can't be played in a
        park. Getting to the 'court' often takes lots of research and effort. The best crags are out of
         the way and require hiking to get to them making them hard to discover and almost impossible 
         to describe with verbal directions.
        
        Being a rock climber with the ability to make websites, I'm proposing a the creating of a 
        website as a gathering place for climbers. They can share their favorite climbs with maps how 
        to get there, advice on how to climb it, pictures of the route, and the public can leave reviews
         or updates about the status of the route.
        
        </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience for this website is anyone looking to find new route to climb outdoors near them. 
          This could be someone who has been rock climbing for years and is itching for something new
          or it could be someone who is new to the hobby and wants to find a good first climb. If 
          you've ever spent time hiking to a route someone told you about just to discover it's way 
          too easy or impossibly hard, you would be a in our target audience.

      <h3>Explore Routes (page 2)</h3>
      <p>
        The best routes are often the hardest to find. Here is a curated selection of crags with directions, ratings, tips, and pictures. All the information you need to pick your next project route.
      </p>
      </p>
      <p class="heise">Heise Rock is a large boulder placed into a field like it was dropped from the sky. There are multiple routes around this rock, but the main pro to this spot 
        is that the ground around the bottom is a flat lawn making belaying a breeze. The routes here range from 5.6 - 5.12 with the majority being 5.11 and 5.12. Recent reports say
        that the property was recently bought and the owner does not allow use of the rock at this time, but we will contine to update as more information becomes available.
      </p>
      <p class="teton">The teton dam is a playground for boulderers. When the teton dam broke 1976 the rushing water behind it dislodges many large boulders and threw them around this
        whole valley. Walking along the river makes for some beautiful views and it's easy to stumble upon large rocks great for bouldering. There are more than 80 reported climbs in this area 
      all of which are bouldering so switch your rope out for a pad and bring some friends to spot you. The routes rank anywhere from V2 - V11 so there's something for everyone here. 
      </p>
      <p class="pointless">The pointless crag is one of the most recognizable in this area. It's a long, uniform rock wall with about 18 routes ranging from 5.7 - 5.12b. The great part
        about this place is that if you're not comfortable lead climbing, you don't have to! It's an easy hike around the right side of the wall to get to the top and simply tying the 
        rope into the top anchors makes it an easy top roping experience just like if you were in the gym. The ground around the base of the hill is a little steep so finding a comfortable
        place to belay from is the biggest challenge here.

      <h3>FAQ Page (page 3)</h3>
      <p>
        Don't worry if you have questions, you're not the only one. Here are the most common questions we've been asked bundled together for your convenience!
      </p>
      <p>#1 What are the different types of climbing and what do they mean? </p>
      <p>There are many different ways of rock climbing, but the 3 ones we will refer to here are: top roping, lead climbing, and bouldering. Top roping is the most similar to what you would
        see in the gym and consists of the rope going from the belayer through the top loops of the route to the climber. Lead climbing is similar, but instead of starting with the rope at the top, 
        you need to climb to bolts in the rock and clip in as you go. Bouldering is much different because you'll never get higher that 10 feet off the ground so ropes are not needed, instead you use 
        pads on the ground and have your partners spot you to keep your head from hitting the ground if you fall.
      </p>
      <p>#2 Is outdoor climbing safe? </p>
      <p>There is always a certain level of risk when rock climbinb, but going outdoors on rock isn't nessecarily any more dangerous than being in the gym. You are at risk of obtaining the same injuries,
        but since these out door location are often further away from medical treatment it's wise to always err on the side of caution and not take unnessecary risks.
      </p>
      <p>#3 What is belaying? </p>
      <p>Belaying is the act of pulling slack out of the rope so if the climber loses their grip they won't fall and risk injury. Belayers and climbers go hand in hand and work as a team, communication 
        between them is crucial for both of their safety. If you've never been climbing or learned how to belay please go to your local rock climbing gym to become certified in this critical role.

        Wireframes

        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The three images on in the center of the page will all link to page two and will have hover effects to indicate to the user that they aren't just static images.

      <h3>Explore Page</h3>
      <p>         
        With the Lorem Ipsum text in the boxes it makes me think there might be an issue keeping the 3 text boxes separate, so I may add a line to divide them if the real text makes it look crowded.

      <h3>FAQ Page</h3>
      <p>         
        Similar to the text boxes on page 2 I added the vertical lines more as a suggestion if the page feels like a block of text. I don't think I'll add them to the final draft I was just testing it as an option.
